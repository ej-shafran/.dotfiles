# kanata

This package contains configuration for `kanata`, a keyboard remapper.

[See more here](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata).

## Linux

If you're on Linux, you can run the `linux.sh` script to make Kanata start up as a service (it will require your password).

## macOS

If you're on macOS, you can run the `macos.sh` script to make Kanata start up as a service (it will require your password). You'll have to add the `kanata` executable to the <kbd>Input Monitoring</kbd> setting in System Settings.

Also, please notice that Mac requires Karabiner for kanata to work properly; see [here](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata?tab=readme-ov-file#build-it-yourself) (the macOS section).
